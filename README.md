# Earthquake Visualization
## Overview 
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. For this visualization the data set consists of all earthquakes from the past 7 days [link to JSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson).

Leaflet library is used to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

## Technology
Leaflet, D3, JSON, HTML, CSS.
